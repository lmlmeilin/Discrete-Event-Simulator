**Discrete Event Simulator**

For this discrete event simulator project, 
I've applied concepts from object-oriented and functional programming paradigms,
building upon knowledge from a programming course (CS2030 Programming Methodology II). The project focuses on modeling activities and events within a shop environment 
involving customers.
Using principles such as objects, classes, inheritance, and interfaces from object-oriented programming, as well as concepts like lambda expressions, closures, and effect-free programming
from functional programming, I've developed a program capable of simulating the discrete events and interactions occurring within the shop.
This involved designing a JAVA program and employing advanced programming constructs to accurately represent the dynamic nature of the shop environment.
